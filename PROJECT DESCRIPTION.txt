The object of this project is to find and classify different types of cannabis strains. 

FIRST PART
At first I got all the data from main API @ http://strainapi.evanbusse.com. 
I transformed the data into json and from json into pandas Dataframe. Then I converted the "effects" column (containing three dictionaries of lists) into three columns.

SECOND PART
Then I defined the main functions: from user's imput you can classify strains with multiple parameters of positive effects, medical issues, and negative effects to avoid. 

EXTRAS
When all dataframe is filtered, I added two function. 
The first one tell the users which strain race works better (probability percentage) based on user's imput.
The second retrieves all flavours yet available (from the filtered database) and let the user filter again and find the strains with his favorite flavor, from the previous dataframe. 
PD: I left the flavor filter at the end because I considered this as a secondary factor. 

THE AIM OF THE PROJECT
The aim of this project is to create a prototype algorithm from which you can build a "find your strain" app.
